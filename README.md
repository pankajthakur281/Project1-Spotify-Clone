# Project1-Spotify-Clone
A responsive Spotify-inspired web music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It dynamically loads songs and playlists from folders, displays album cards, and lets users play, pause, skip, and control volume.
The UI features a sidebar library, a bottom playbar, and a clean responsive design for desktop and mobile.
This project recreates the look and feel of Spotify while focusing on interactive functionality and smooth playback.
